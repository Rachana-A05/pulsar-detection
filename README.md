# 🌌 **Application of Machine Learning Methods to Identify and Categorize Radio Pulsar Signal Candidates**

## 📘 Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning models to identify **pulsar candidates** from radio astronomy data (HTRU2 dataset). The models were evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 🧠 Models Used
The following supervised learning models were implemented and compared:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

Each model was evaluated using:  
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- ROC-AUC Curve
