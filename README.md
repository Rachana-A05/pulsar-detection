\# 🌌 Pulsar Detection using Machine Learning



\## 📘 Overview



This project applies supervised machine learning models to identify \*\*pulsar candidates\*\* from radio astronomy data (HTRU2 dataset).

The models were evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

├── Pulsar\_AM223\_AM218.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook with full code

├── README.md                        # Project overview and setup instructions

├── requirements.txt                 # List of dependencies for installation

&nbsp;   └── pulsar\_data.csv              # Your dataset file (if stored locally)

```



\### 📘 Notes:



\* Keep all files inside the \*\*same main folder (`pulsar-detection-ML/`)\*\*.

\* The `data/` folder is optional — only needed if you’re storing the dataset locally.

\* When you upload this folder to GitHub, your structure will stay organized and easy for faculty or TAs to navigate.





\## 📈 Project Workflow



1\. \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\* – Handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection

2\. \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\* – Distribution plots and correlation analysis
